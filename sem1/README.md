Commands with their flags, arguments (or without) are entered to enter this program.
To terminate this program, the word “quit” must be entered. 
This program describes three functions get_list () for reading the entire command, get_word () for reading individual words, and free_list () for clearing the allocated dynamic memory after the program ends.
When you enter a non-existing command, the program notifies the user about this, but does not end.
